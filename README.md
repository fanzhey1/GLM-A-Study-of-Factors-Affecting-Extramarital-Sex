# Generalized-Linear-Model-Projects-in-R

This project implemented Generalized Lienar Model using R, produced statistical reports, to solve two questions: 
1. What are the factors influencing the chance that an individual has an affair?
2. What are the factors affecting smoking rate among American teenagers?


For the first question: The research question of interest concerns the effect of having children on the chances that men and women
have affairs. It is hypothesized that becoming a mother will make a woman less likely to have extramarital
sex, whereas men are believed to be more likely to have affairs once they become fathers. The individual
making this hypothesis has a knowledge of human behaviour based entirely on viewing TV sitcoms, and
believes women become insular and overly protective once they become mothers but new fathers are likely
to feel neglected and constrained.

For the second question: The research hypotheses to be investigated using this survey are as follows.
1. Smoking of cigars, cigarillos or little cigars is no more common amongst Americans of European
ancestry than for Hispanic-Americans and African-Americans, once one accounts for the fact that
white Americans more likely to live in rural areas and cigar smoking is a rural phenomenon.
2. The likelihood of having used a electronic cigarettes on at least one occasion is the same for two
individuals of the different sexes, provided their age, ethnicity, and other demographic characteristics
are similar.
